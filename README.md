## Getting Started  
  
To get a copy of the project, you can go on the GitHub's webpage of the project and click on the green button to download as a .ZIP file. However, if you're using a prompt console on an Unix machine use this line :

```
git clone https://github.com/Franck1333/Distributeur_de_Liquide.git
```
  
### Prerequisites  
  
To use the project, you will need some Hardware :
  
```  
An Arduino Board  (here: Arduino Nano, https://tinyurl.com/arduinoMiniboards)
An OLED Screen  (here: 128 x 64, https://tinyurl.com/oledscreenarduino)
A Relay (https://tinyurl.com/RelayDDL)
Four LEDs (For the SWAGG, https://tinyurl.com/LEDsDDL)
Four 220 Ohms Resistors (To protect the LEDs, https://tinyurl.com/resistorDDL)
One 1K Ohm Resistor (To use a button with the board +, https://tinyurl.com/resistorDDL)
The pump (https://tinyurl.com/pumpDDL)
Two Button (To Interact with the board, https://tinyurl.com/buttonDDL)
```  
 *Also, a breadboard or PCB and also Wires and tools needed to solder.*
 
  And you will also need some libraries and softwares :

```
- An Arduino IDE Up to date
- An Arduino board
```

### Downloading/Installing
To get and downloaded the files, use this line : 
```
git clone https://github.com/Franck1333/Distributeur_de_Liquide.git
```
When the project is Downloaded, check your folder, and you will see the folder `Distributeur_de_Liquide` .

## Run
#### The Way to run the project :

 1. To run the project; You need to compile and upload the Source code
    to the Arduino Board by using the Arduino IDE

 2. When it's done, you should assembly all the component on a
    breadboard or solder all the components on a PCB

 3. When the last step is done, You must Power on by pluggin an USB power source to your Arduino boards and if you didn't make any mistakes , It's Works.

## Running the tests  
  
That's how to test the program:
Use the Arduino IDE with your files

    <file>.ino

## The Folders and Files

In this project we've got some folders

#### Folders
```
- 3D_Model: 3D Files needed to create a cases for the device.
- Pictures: Pictures of the project.
```
#### Files in "/Distributeur_de_Liquide/"

Main features of the program
```
- Distributeur_de_Liquide.ino: That's main program.
- Components_list.html: This is the list of components needed for this project.
- Schema & Schema_bb: Are the diagrams of the project made on 'Fritzing'.
```
